# manhunt
this is my recreation of popular YouTuber "Dreams" manhunt minecraft plugin, optimized for minecraft 1.15+, allowing one or multiple player/s to track and hunt down an individual, making for an interesting and adrenaline filled minigame

## installation
export as a .jar file, and import into the FTP files of your minecraft server. Ensure the server is running an updated version of Bukkit, and restart your server.

```bash
/behunter
```
establishes the command sender as a prey
```bash

```
